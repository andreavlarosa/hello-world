# hello-world

Hello, everyone! I'm Andie, a tech geek and WordPress enthusiast living in sunny beautiful Central Florida. Currently I'm studying Python so that I can become a better coder, and working toward my PMP certification because I love organizing technical projects! In my downtime, I like to watch movies and TV shows about superheroes, go hiking or kayaking, read voraciously or hang out at DisneyWorld. I am also killer at karaoke.
